Scouts said that he was the type of player who could get shots off from anywhere, and his basketball IQ was off the charts. After being drafted to the Hornets, he was traded immediately to the Los Angeles Lakers(craziest fumble oat). He was just 17 entering the league, and he averaged 7.6 points per game. He won the Dunk contest in 1997, and by his second season, he suddenly turned into an NBA Allstar while averaging 15 ppg.";

Kobe scored the second highest points in a game with 81 points against the Toronto Raptors, which was a crazy feat. During the 2008 era, they Lakers built around Kobe, using players like Pau Gasol, which helped them reach the championship stage once again. They lose to the Celtics in 2008, beat the Magic in 2009, and beat the Celtics in 2010. Kobe was finals MVP during the 2009 and 2010 championships.";
